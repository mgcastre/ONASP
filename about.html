      <h1>National Groundwater Observatory of Panama (ONASP)</h1>
      <h2>What is ONASP?</h2>
      <p>
        The National Groundwater Observatory of Panama (ONASP by its acronym in s) is an initiative to share groundwater level and other hydrogeological data
        with users and decision-makers, so that they have information about the behaviour of groundwater in the region. This web application was designed as a 
        <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny App</a> and the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R programming language</a>. The functionality and look 
        and feel of the site is based on the <a href="http://ucwater.org/gw_obs/">California Groundwater Observatory</a> and the 
        <a href="https://caccr.github.io/">California Groundwater Quality Observatory</a> both designed and built by 
        <a href="https://www.richpauloo.com/">Rich Pauloo</a>.

      <h2>Projec's History</h2>
      <p>
        In May 2015, the country's first groundwater level monitoring network was established in the central part of the Azuero penninsula in south-central Panama, 
        by María Gabriela Castrellón, as part of her undergraduate thesis project, under the supervision of Dr. Amvrossios C. Bagtzoglou and Dr. Gonzalo Pulido. 
        The thesis document can be found <a href="https://opencommons.uconn.edu/srhonors_theses/545/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Groundwater level data is collected monthly by staff from the Regional Office of Herrera and Los Santos and the Department of Groundwaer Sources of the 
        National Water Supply and Sanitation Agengy (<a href="https://www.idaan.gob.pa/">IDAAN</a>). The groundwater level monitoring program has continued thanks
        to funding received to investigate the hydrogeological properties and groundwater flow patterns of the Estibana River Sub-Catchment through project 
        <a href="https://hidrogeologia.utp.ac.pa/">Senacyt IOMA17-006</a> lead by Dr. José Fábrega.

      <h2>What are groundwater levels and how are they measured?</h2>
      <p>
        Groundwater levels are the distance from the terrain surface to the surface of the water table in an unconfined aquifer. This distance is 
        known as depth to water, which is measured in observation wells called piezometer using either a <a href="https://youtu.be/b23FvXkD6VM">steel</a>
        or an <a href="https://youtu.be/jknI9anIwF4">electric</a> tape. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For the ONASP monitoring network, the piezometers are production wells (6 to 8 inches in diameter) drilled by IDAAN that are either abandoned or 
        could not be connected to the distribution network due to poor water quality or low yield.
      </p>
      <h2>Why are groundwater monitoring networks important?</h2>
      <p>
        It is very difficult to study how groundwater moves and fluctuates because we can't see it. Also, groundwater moves very slowly and patterns can only
        be spotted with consistent and relatively abundant data. A monitoring network provides continouos measurements with monthly, daily, hourly or even 
        sub-hourly intervals which allow hydrologists and hydrogeologists to take a "snapshot" of the groundwater system at any given time. Comparing snapshots
        and making time-series plots (hydrographs), such as the ones shown in this web application, allows us to identify trends and make decisions regarding 
        the management of this ofter forgotten resource.
